title: About Jane Li
---

I am a Senior Data Scientist at Paramount Pictures. I use machine learning, hypothesis testing, and data visualization to provide quantitative insights for decision making at all stages of movie production and marketing. I hope by marrying data science with the art of movie making we can bridge the gap between creators and viewers and craft successful movies and effective marketing campaigns.   

I hold a Ph.D degree in Geography. My [dissertation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622818304211) focuses on predicting future urban development and land use change under various policy scenarios. My [Postdoc research](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2019.00277/full) was using crowded sourced wildlife occurrence data to understand biodiversity inside cities and develop management plans to enhance urban biodiversity. I have always been committed to produce data-driven actionable solutions to complex issues throughout my career.

A few interesting things about me. I am an Ashtanga yogi, and I think it is fun to put my legs behind my head or to walk on my hands. But most importantly, it is helps me to have a piece of quiet mind and focusing on self-improvement. No surprise, as a native Chinese, I have my unquestionable love for food. Lastly, I love learning. Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, new recipes, or miscellaneous facts about the universe.

Thanks for reading!
